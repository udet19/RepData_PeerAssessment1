## Loading and preprocessing the data

First we have to read the data from ZIP and take a short look at the data:
```{r readdata, echo=TRUE}
rawdata <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv") , header = TRUE)
str(rawdata)
```

Now again from the other perspective:

```{r headrawdata}
head(rawdata, 10)
```

The dataset contains missing values. Now we will count them:

```{r missingvalues, echo=TRUE}
missingValues <- nrow(rawdata[is.na(rawdata),])
```

There are `r missingValues` missing values.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
